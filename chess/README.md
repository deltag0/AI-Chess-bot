# AI CHESS BOT
Chess AI bot made in python using the minimax algorithm with optimizations such as alpha-beta pruning, transposition tables, move ordering, parsing through games for openings, etc.
Capable of play at an ELO ~1500 (lichess)

## How It's Made:

**Technology & references:** Python, pygame, python-chess, https://www.chessprogramming.org/Simplified_Evaluation_Function#Knights, https://www.chessprogramming.org/Main_Page, https://www.cs.cornell.edu/boom/2004sp/ProjectArch/Chess/algorithms.html, https://database.lichess.org/

## Lessons learned:

* Greatly improved OOP skills

* Learned about many new algorithms and how to design and apply them on my own

* Improved documentation skills

* Acquired knowledge on system deisgn

## Optimizations

* Alpha beta pruning

* Move ordering

* Opening Database

* Transposition tables

* Quiescence search

* Board heatmap

With all these techniques, the number of searches can be cut down by 1000x at some points!
